# Navigating-Consumer-Decision-making-in-E-commerce-

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a sophisticated consumer decision-making model for E-commerce platforms using advanced data analytics, machine learning, and AI techniques. It involves collecting and analyzing large-scale consumer behavior data, implementing predictive models, and creating a real-time recommendation system.

## Key Features

- Web scraping of e-commerce platforms
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Machine learning model development (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Hybrid recommendation system
- A/B testing framework

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/e-commerce-analysis.git
   cd e_commerce_analysis
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the main script:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Key Components

### Web Scraping (web_scraper.py)

The `ECommerceScraper` class in `web_scraper.py` is responsible for collecting product data from e-commerce websites. It uses BeautifulSoup to parse HTML and extract relevant information.

### Data Cleaning (data_cleaner.py)

The `DataCleaner` class in `data_cleaner.py` handles data preprocessing tasks such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and normalizing numeric features.

### Machine Learning Models (ml_models.py)

The `MLModels` class in `ml_models.py` implements and trains Random Forest and XGBoost models for predicting consumer behavior. It includes functionality for hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

### Recommendation System (recommender.py)

The `HybridRecommender` class in `recommender.py` implements a hybrid recommendation system that combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering approaches.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement deep learning models for natural language processing of product reviews
- Develop a real-time data processing pipeline using Apache Kafka and Spark Streaming
- Create a comprehensive dashboard for monitoring key performance indicators
